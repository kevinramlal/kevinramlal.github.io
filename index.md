Hello World. My name is Kevin, I am a graduate from the Master in Financial Engineering program at UC Berkeley. I am deeply interested in market-making and applications of quantitative techniques in the field of market microstructure. 

This website serves as a landing page for two projects.
1. [Market Making Roadmap](articles_index.md)

- A series of articles and resources designed to provide a high-level overview of basic theories in market-making, market microstructure, and trading. The goal is to provide a *roadmap* for the reader to dive further into more advanced topics within the world of market-making. 


2. Q-Book (In Progress)
- A python based orderbook simulator
